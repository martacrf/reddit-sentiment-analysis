# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Reddit Sentiment Analysis.

## Exploration of sentiment trends and key discussion topics across multiple subreddits using Natural Language Processing, comparing data from 2019 to the present.

#### Key question: Are people angrier these days or is there hope?
Determine the tendency of negative feelings among people in the world by analyzing the sentiment of comments on Reddit. We will compare comments from 2019 to those from the present across 40 subreddits. Our aim is to identify whether comments have become more negative or positive over time and uncover the key words frequently used in discussions.

#### Key Areas of Analysis:
Sentiment Trends: Analyze whether there is an observable trend in the sentiment of Reddit comments over time. Are comments becoming more negative or positive?
Topic Identification: Discover what people are talking about in various subreddits by identifying common themes and topics.
Frequent Words: Determine the most frequently occurring words in comments to understand the general sentiment and topics of discussion.
General Sentiment: Assess the overall sentiment distribution of comments to see if they are predominantly positive or negative.
